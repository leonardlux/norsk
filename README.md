Anki dataset for norwegian for foreigners

## Getting started:

(I only did this on a MacOs Laptop, so your approach might vary)

1. You need to install [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778)
    + this can be done through: Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons... -> "1788670778"
    + for an in-depth description look at the page of [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778)
2. Then restart Anik
3. Then copy the repo to your harddrive (normal git stuff)
4. To import the deck: File -> CrowdAnki: Import from disk -> selected folder norsk in git repo
5. done 

## To share your additions

Export the deck as "CrowdAnki JSON representation (directory)" on top of the Norsk folder in the git repo. Then add -> commit -> push the git repo.  
Then everybody can share with everybody and we can see the changes. 

## Other option 
A but more hussel and corrections hard to make: Just post the .apkg in the group. 

And have fun xD

## A few comments about my ideas with cards:
I used "Basic (and reverse card)" to have engl. -> norsk and norsk -> engl. card while only having to write one. All the error corretions are also automaticly applied to both cards.

I used tags for:

+ Lessons in which they took place `L01`, `L02`, etc.
+ kind of word: `noun`, `verb`, `adj`, `adv`, `pronoun`, `prep` (`modalverb`? dont know if this is usefull)
+ Categories: `clothes`, `weekdays`, `expressions` feel free to add more :)
+ I used `quest` in the cases where I dont know if the stuff is correct xD
    
Other Stuff:

+ each noun has a preposition to indicate the gender: n = et, m = en, f = ei(if the noun was in plural as a standard I added [pl.])
+ Translation is always in englisch, but if german (or any other language) has similar words, I used these [Ger.: the similär wörd]
