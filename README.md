Anki dataset for norwegian for foreigners

## Getting started:

(I only did this on a MacOs Laptop, so your approach might vary)

1. You need to install [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778)
    + this can be done through: Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons... -> "1788670778"
    + for an in-depth description look at the page of [CrowdAnki](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1788670778)
2. Then restart Anik
3. Then copy the repo to your harddrive (normal git stuff)
4. To import the deck: File -> CrowdAnki: Import from disk -> selected folder norsk in git repo
5. done 

## To share your additions

Export the deck as "CrowdAnki JSON representation (directory)" on top of the Norsk folder in the git repo. Then add -> commit -> push the git repo.  
Then everybody can share with everybody and we can see the changes. 

## Other option 
A but more hussel and corrections hard to make: Just post the .apkg in the group. 

And have fun xD
